                <p>My name is Tejas Kulkarni. I was born in Mountain View, California, but I
                    moved to Washington state at a very young age. I was raised in WA and still
                    currently reside here. One fun fact about me is that my favorite season is
                    winter. I hope you enjoy the portfolio that I have set up for you today.

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <!--background, education, career goals, personal interests-->
                    <p> I am 22 years old, and here is a short description of me. I attented and graduated
                        Eastlake High School, and then attented the University of Massachusetts Amherst
                        for a couple years. I am hoping to work as a software developer in the future,
                        and pursuing the Coding Temple bootcamp has set me on the right path to working
                        towards my career goals. Some of my personal interests include playing tennis,
                        video games, and cooking. Moving forward through this portfolio, you can see
                        some of my more technical skills and achievements in the next sections.

                        <p>
                            This API allows users to manage data in an e-commerce setting.
                            The user can access API requests relating to customer management,
                            customer account management, product management, and orders management.
                            For each of these categories, there are routes to create new datapoints,
                            read datapoints, update datapoints, and delete datapoints.
                            The data is stored in a SQL database using Flask-SQLAlchemy for integration.
                            In addition, there are routes with bonus funcionality if needed by the user.
                            There is capability to view and manage stock levels of individual products,
                            and an automatic restocking function when stock is low. A user could also view
                            the complete order history of a specific customer, or calculate the total price of an order.

                            This application allows user to manage a library system via command line inputs.
                            There are 3 core components to this library management system.
                            Users are able to store information about books, users, authors.
                            Users can add new books, users, and authors, to the system, and search for
                            each of these at a later time. The newly added data is stored in a SQL database.
                            There is also functionality to check out a book, and return it at a later date.
                            There is one copy of each book available until checked out. Once a
                            book has been checked out, it must be returned before it can be checked out
                            again. All checked out books are stored in a table with a borrow and return date.
                            This can be accessed to see overall how often people are using the library system.
                            There is also functionality to view all books, authors, and users in the system.
                            Users can also search for specific books by their title or isbn.
                            This allows users to easily see which books are available and which arent.
