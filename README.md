# Personal Portfolio Enhancement Project
In this project, I improve upon a previous project where I built a personal portfolio webpage using html. I've now added css files to stylize the webpage and make it much more engaging. The webpage is now much more interactive, and encourages users to stick around and find everything they can see on our page. I've also separated the feedback form to separate page for easier user navigation and easier css implementation.
